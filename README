Each instruction occupies the 5 higher order bits of a byte
The lower three bits are used for specifying special forms of the instruction
as follows:

NOP: no special form
PUSH: if 0, then push an immediate value
        otherwise, push the corresponding register
POP: bottom 3 bits specify the register (cannot be 000)
MOV: consumes 2 bytes MINIMUM for the instruction
    First 3 bits (destination):
        000 -> memory location
        001-111 -> register
    Next 4 bits (source):
        1XXX -> immediate value
        0000 -> memory location
        0001-0111 -> register
    Next bit:
        Dereference source?
    Next bit:
        Dereference destination?
    Next 2 bits:
        00 -> 32-bit move
        01 -> 16-bit move
        10 -> 8-bit move
        11 -> 4-bit move


    1. Moving into register, or memory location? (3 bits)
    2. Moving from register, or memory location, or immediate value? (4 bits)
    3. Dereference the source? (1 bit)
    4. Dereference the destination? (1 bit)
    5. Size of move? [D, W, B, L, H] (3 bits)

ADD/SUB/MUL/AND/OR/NOT/XOR/NAND/NOR:
    First 3 bits (destination) [same as MOV]
    Next 4 bits (source) [same as MOV]
    Next 2 bits are ignored
    Final 2 bits are size
